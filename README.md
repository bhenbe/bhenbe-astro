# Welcome to the source code of [Bhen.be](https://bhen.be)

This website is developped with [Astro](https://astro.build) using [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) as CMS and hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public (for everything that doesn't need to be processed)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
